# The Codes involved in the Experiment Section of "FedNP: Towards Non-IID Federated Learning via Federated Neural Propagation"

## Installation

### Prerequisites

We run all experiments on a machine with 314 GB RAM, an Intel Xeon PHI 7290 CPU
Processor, and two Tesla V100 GPUs. The operation system is CentOS 7. For
detailed versions of software environments, please refer to the `README.md`
files in corresponding code directories.

### Dataset Preperation

The links or methods to access
the datasets used in the experiments are provided in `README.md` as well.

## Experiments

1. To run experiments involved in  **5.2 Toy Experiment**, please see `FedNP for toy experiment/README.md`
2. To run experiments involved in  **5.3 Image Classification with Non-IID Image Dataset**,  please see `FedNP for image classification/README.md.`
3. To run experiments involved in **5.4 Speech Recognition with Large-scale Non-IID Conversational Speech Dataset**, please see  `FedNP for speech recognition/README.md`
